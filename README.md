## Bluetooth-Based Emergency Response System with RSSI and MAODV

## Introduction
In times of crisis, efficient emergency response is paramount for ensuring the safety of individuals and communities. However, traditional emergency response mechanisms often face challenges in timely and coordinated actions. This project introduces a Bluetooth-based Emergency Response System, leveraging Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) and Modified Ad hoc On-Demand Vector (MAODV) routing protocol, to enhance emergency response coordination and communication.

## Problem Statement
- Detection System Development: Develop a detection system capable of identifying target nodes (e.g., vehicles) within a Bluetooth network using RSSI.
- Emergency Broadcast System Creation: Create an emergency broadcast system using a modified MAODV protocol to disseminate emergency alerts to identified nodes based on RSSI readings.
- System Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the developed system in terms of detection accuracy and response time under simulated emergency scenarios.

## Significance
This project addresses critical aspects of emergency response:

- Improved Response Efficiency: By leveraging Bluetooth technology and advanced routing protocols, the system enables swift and coordinated emergency response actions.
